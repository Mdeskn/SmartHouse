# Smart House Project

## Description
The **Smart House** project offers a comprehensive simulation of energy supply and consumption in a smart home environment. It incorporates advanced features to manage smart devices, energy sources, and their interactions, providing real-time insights through simulation and logging. Built with Java, this project showcases cutting-edge concurrency and multithreading capabilities, while also offering robust exception handling and interactive user interfaces for seamless management.

---

## Key Features and Requirements

### Concurrency and Interactive Features
- An interactive user interface (CLI) implemented in `Main.java` enables streamlined management of devices and energy sources.
- Real-time simulation in `HouseManager` showcases the simultaneous energy generation and consumption process, with thread-safe concurrency ensured by the `TaskScheduler` class.
- Advanced task scheduling facilitates dynamic operations, allowing concurrent energy resource allocation and device management without conflict.

### Simulation and Logs
- Detailed simulation logs are captured in the `Logger` class, tracking energy source states, device consumption, and runtime events, providing valuable insights.
- Exception handling through the `ExceptionHandler` class safeguards the system, ensuring it remains resilient against runtime errors and interruptions.

### Initial Settings
- Users can dynamically upload and load initial settings for devices and energy sources through file-handling capabilities in the `FileHandler` class.

### Unit Testing
- Extensive unit tests validate the functionality of each subsystem, ensuring the robustness and reliability of the entire project.

### Simulation of Energy and Device Management
- The simulation, implemented in `HouseManager` and supported by the `EnergyController` and `ApplianceController`, effectively models energy generation from Solar, Wind, and Water sources, each with unique regeneration rates.
- Devices like Lights (`Light.java`), Air Conditioners (`AirConditioner.java`), and Televisions (`Television.java`) dynamically consume energy, mimicking real-world behavior.
- The system balances energy demand and supply, dynamically allocating energy resources to active devices.

### Logging and Error Handling
- **Logger**: Implemented in `Logger.java` to capture simulation logs, track errors, and maintain detailed operational records.
- **ExceptionHandler**: Handles runtime errors effectively, providing a seamless user experience even in unexpected scenarios.

### File Handling
- Device and energy source configurations are initialized from `initial_energy.txt`, supporting user-defined setups for maximum flexibility via the `FileHandler` class.

### Unit Testing
- A dedicated test suite, including `HouseManagerTest.java`, `EnergyControllerTest.java`, and `ApplianceControllerTest.java`, validates the functionality of each module, ensuring high-quality code and robust system behavior.

## System Architecture
- **Main Class**: Acts as the entry point for the CLI and overall system control.
- **Device Controllers**: Manage the addition, removal, and status of smart devices.
- **Energy Controller**: Oversees energy source operations and allocation.
- **House Manager**: Coordinates energy consumption and generation, simulating real-world energy dynamics.
- **Utilities**: Provide essential services like logging, file handling, and error management.
